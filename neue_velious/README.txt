Neue Velious
Compliled by Oook of Agnarr
Version 1.2 - March 9, 2019
Folder Name: neue_velious

-----------------------------------------
Updated March 9, 2019
1.2 - Updated to be compatible with current patch. Likely reverted some of the changes made in 1.1 to remove titles for a number of windows. Hope to work on fixing some contrast issues on buttons in the future.

Updated June 23, 2017
1.1 - Removed titles from a number of windows that are typically always on screen to better match the original transparent UI. Added necessary UI files for these windows instead of using the default.


Updated June 11, 2017
Initial release - this is lightly modified version of Drakah's Default "Old" Interface, which uses the window pieces and spell gems from Antioch's FD Classic UI.

Neue Velious is a throwback to the original Kunark/Velious UI and uses the original pre-Luclin spell icons and gems.
